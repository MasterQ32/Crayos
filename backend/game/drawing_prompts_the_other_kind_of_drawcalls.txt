A bunch of crazy stuff falling out of a wizards backpack
A carnivorous plant overstepping boundaries
A cat rummaging a drawer searching for its toy
A cowboy shooting holes in a wheel of cheese
A game developer trying to make a game
A group a rats playing a poker game
A hummingbird steering through a hurricane
A kangaroo making a clever use of its pouch
A ladybug doing a go-go-dance
Aliens making experiments with an astronaut
An octopus making a crazy big sandwich
A pretty panda admiring itself in the mirror
A princess breaking the stereotype
A robot with a beer belly
A scarecrow who really loves birds
A scene from your favorite fairytale
A sheep doing silly faces
A snake doing the most difficult yoga pose
A squirrell with very slippy hands trying to eat a peanut
A sword fight between enemy vegetables
A t-rex trying to paint its toe nails
A valentine's date that went terribly wrong
A vampire who is afraid of garlic bread
A very erotic space rocket about to start off
A viking tripping over his beard
A zombie disco
Finding something weird in mommy's nightstand drawer
Mr Krabs at a Counter Strike LAN-party
Surfing but with a very unusual surfboard
The first thing Chuck Norris does in the morning
The Joker stealing the Batmobile
The weirdest wedding you have ever seen
Whatever you would do first when you get stranded on a desert island
